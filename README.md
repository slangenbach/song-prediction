# Song prediction case study

## Ideas
* Apply concepts from deep learning for images to audio spectrums
* Use fastai for modeling
* Investigate whether it makes sense to use Kedro to structure the project
* Deploy infrastructure through CDK/CloudFormation
* Depoy model via SageMaker
* Build app with Streamlit
